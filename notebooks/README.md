Many of these notebooks are still in development.

The `dev` folder is old notebooks that I'm keeping it for posterity for now (you can ignore these, they are probably outdated)

The `analysis` folder is where I'm actively messing with data to figure out what theta sweeps are good for

Everything else is more general (inserting sessions, fetching data, decoding)
